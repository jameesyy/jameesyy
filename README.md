### Hi friend ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student at UW-Madison. I'm interested in the cloud, software security, high-performance programming, and writing idiomatic code.
Outside of programming, I like lifting, writing poems, and skygazing.

Rather than a programmer, I am a creativeâ€”a writer and storyteller. I gather stories and aphorisms worth putting in writing. From those nuggets of truth I discover problems worth solving.

Above being a software engineer, I am a writer. It just happens that I write code.
